# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify the sentiment of text data as positive, negative, or neutral. The project leverages various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate sentiment classification.

## Project Structure

- **Sentiment analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow of the sentiment analysis project, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **data/**: Directory containing datasets used for training and testing the models.
- **models/**: Saved machine learning models for future predictions.
- **results/**: Directory where results, plots, and evaluation metrics are stored.
- **README.md**: Project overview and setup instructions.

## Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction using TF-IDF and Word Embeddings
- Sentiment Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Model Evaluation with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
- Visualization of Sentiment Distribution

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
    cd sentiment-analysis
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Sentiment analysis.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
2. **Training**: Open the notebook and follow the instructions to train the model.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model performance on the test dataset.
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict sentiments of new text data.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset. The confusion matrix and classification report are available in the `results/` directory.

## Future Work

- Implementing deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for improved accuracy.
- Enhancing data preprocessing by handling more linguistic nuances.
- Expanding the dataset to include more diverse text samples.
